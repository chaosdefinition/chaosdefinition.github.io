Task mapping in modern high performance parallel computers can be modeled as a
graph embedding problem, which simulates the mapping as embedding one graph
into another and try to find the minimum wirelength for the mapping. Though
embedding problems have been considered for several regular graphs, such as
hypercubes into grids, binary trees into grids, et al, it is still an open
problem for hypercubes into cylinders. In this paper, we consider the problem
of embedding hypercubes into cylinders to minimize the wirelength. We obtain
the exact wirelength formula of embedding hypercube *Q<sup>r</sup>* into
cylinder *C<sub>2<sup>3</sup></sub>* &times; *P<sub>2<sup>râˆ’3</sup></sub>* with
*r* &ge; 3.
